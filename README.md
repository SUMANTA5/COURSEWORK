CSE 1341-Fall 2018 / Principles of Computer Science I

Introduction
Welcome to CSE 1341. This course will provide an introduction to the fundamental concepts of
computer science, programming and object-oriented design of reusable modules. The course covers
basic object-oriented concepts like composition, inheritance, polymorphism and containers. To get the
most out of this class and ultimately to be successful, you must be willing to work hard.

Office Hours: Monday 6:00-6:30pm and other times as announced in class. 
Schedule changes will be announced in class.

Textbook
Principles of Computer Science: Java Edition, Kendall Hunt Publishing, 
First Edition, Ken Howard. ISBN# 13:978-1-4652-2252-7

Tests
This course will have no final exam, but there will be three tests during the semester. Each test will
take approximately 60 minutes to complete and will focus on the topics discussed since the last test.

Quizzes
In class, we will have 5 scheduled quizzes (see the syllabus for dates). Additionally, surprise
unscheduled quizzes may also be given in class. Each quiz will last 10-15 minutes, held at the end of
class and covers the reading material indicated in the course outline. There are no makeups for
missed quizzes. Instead, each student will be permitted to drop one quiz grade at the end of the
semester. The dropped quiz grade may be used if you miss a quiz due to tardiness or an absence. For
those who don’t miss a quiz, the lowest quiz grade will be dropped automatically.

Programming Assignments and Labs
Almost every week on Friday you will be given a programming assignment which is usually due two
weeks later. The lab assignments consist of two parts, a pre-lab and the lab.
You must have the pre-lab and part of your programming assignment finished before you go to lab.
You have to submit a printout of the completed pre-lab to the TA at the beginning of the lab session. If
you submit the pre-lab during the lab session you will get 50% credit. After the lab you cannot submit
the pre-lab. Lab is designed for you to get clarifications and explanations as needed. Outside lab hours
you can ask questions at the help desk. You need to come prepared to the help desk and ask specific
questions and present written code/pseudocode/UML diagrams. Help desk hours will be posted in the
department (Caruth Hall, 4th floor) and on Canvas.
The lab assignments (not pre-labs) must be submitted to Canvas before the due date. There is usually
an automatic 2 calendar day extension, however you will lose 25% of your grade for the lab. After this
time, Canvas will not allow any submissions. Make sure that you can access Canvas
(http://canvas.smu.edu) and that you are enrolled correctly in your course! Email your instructor
immediately if you are not correctly enrolled.
